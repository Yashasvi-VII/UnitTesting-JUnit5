JUnit 5 Readme
Overview
JUnit 5 is the latest version of the JUnit testing framework for the Java programming language. It is a powerful and flexible tool designed to support the development of robust and maintainable test suites. JUnit 5 is a complete rewrite of JUnit 4 and introduces several new features and improvements.

Key Features
1. JUnit Platform
JUnit 5 introduces the JUnit Platform, a new module that serves as the foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. This platform provides support for discovering, running, and reporting on tests.

2. JUnit Jupiter
JUnit Jupiter is the new programming model for writing tests. It supports the annotations @Test, @BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @BeforeEach, and @AfterEach to define test methods and setup/teardown methods. Additionally, it allows the use of dynamic tests and parameterized tests.

3. Extension Model
JUnit 5 comes with a powerful extension model that allows developers to extend the behavior of the testing framework. This extension model enables the creation of custom annotations, conditions, interceptors, and more.

4. Tagging and Filtering
With JUnit 5, tests can be tagged with annotations, making it easy to categorize and filter tests during execution. This is particularly useful for running specific groups of tests based on their characteristics.

5. Conditional Test Execution
JUnit 5 supports conditional test execution based on certain conditions being met. Conditions can be defined using custom annotations, enabling fine-grained control over when tests should run.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using JUnit 5, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
Adding JUnit 5 to Your Project
To use JUnit 5 in your Java project, add the following dependencies to your build file:

Maven
xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Gradle
gradle
Copy code
testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.8.0'
Writing Your First Test
Create a test class and write a simple test using JUnit Jupiter annotations:

java
Copy code
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class MyTest {

    @Test
    void myTest() {
        assertEquals(2, 1 + 1);
    }
}
Running Tests
JUnit 5 tests can be executed using your favorite IDE, build tool, or the command line. Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions on running tests.
